## Performance Optimizations

### Deals System (`advanceDeals`)
- Transformed O(N) map + O(N) filter into a single O(N) `for` loop in `advanceDeals`.
- Reduced memory allocations by eliminating the intermediate mapped array.
- Measured a ~21% reduction in execution time for heavy loads (100k items, 100 iterations) from ~849ms to ~669ms.
## 2026-03-31 - Iterate over State Records using for...in loops
**Learning:** Using Object.values() on high-frequency State Records (like projects) causes O(N) array allocation per tick, leading to garbage collection spikes.
**Action:** Replace Object.values() with for...in loops when iterating over high-frequency State Records in the engine to avoid O(N) array allocation overhead.
