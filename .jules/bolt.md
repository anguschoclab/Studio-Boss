## Performance Optimizations

### Deals System (`advanceDeals`)
- Transformed O(N) map + O(N) filter into a single O(N) `for` loop in `advanceDeals`.
- Reduced memory allocations by eliminating the intermediate mapped array.
- Measured a ~21% reduction in execution time for heavy loads (100k items, 100 iterations) from ~849ms to ~669ms.
